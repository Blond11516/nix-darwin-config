To get started with this config:

1. Clone this repo and move its contents to `~/.config/nix-darwin`. This file should end up at `~/.config/nix-darwin/README.md`
1. Install Nix with the [Determinate Systems installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer)
1. Install [nix-darwin with flakes](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer) (start at step 2 since you already have a flake.nix)
